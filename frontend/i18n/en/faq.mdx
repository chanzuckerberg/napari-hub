## Using the napari hub

<Accordion
  title="How do I perform more advanced search queries?"
  variant="faq"
>

We use [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for the plugin search engine.
You should be fine with most queries, but if you want to perform more advanced search queries,
you can use [extended search operators](https://fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search)
to fine tune your search results.

#### Examples

By default, whitespace will be considered as an AND operator.
To combine results using OR, use the pipe operator:

```
console | animation
```

To find results that include a word (without fuzzy matching), use the apostrophe operator:

```
'video
```

To find results that start with a particular string, use the prefix operator.

```
^napari
```

Similar to find results that end with a particular string, use the suffix operator:

```
napari$
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Who is building this?"
  variant="faq"

The napari hub is a service of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in collaboration with napari,
built by the CZI imaging team. You can learn more about who is steering
this ship by visiting the [about page]({ABOUT}).

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="I have a neat idea or question not answered here, where do I go?"
  variant="faq"
>

Oh no, we didn’t answer your questions! Our apologies.
We recommend you ask any hub community questions in [github discussions]({HUB_REPO}/discussions)-
we value open source engagement and you never know who might have the right answer!

## Building and sharing plugins

<Accordion title="How do I build a napari plugin?" variant="faq">

You can learn more about building a plugin for napari by reading
[this tutorial](https://napari.org/plugins/stable/for_plugin_developers.html#plugins-for-plugin-developers),
which will guide you through hook specifications, implementation,
and how to share your plugin with the world.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How do I add my plugin to the napari hub?"
  variant="faq"
>

To add your plugin to the napari hub, simply push it to PyPI.
If you used the napari plugin cookiecutter as a template for your plugin, it comes already
[configured to deploy to PyPI when you tag a versioned release](https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#set-up-automatic-deployments).

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How often do you check for new or updated plugins on PyPI?"
  variant="faq"
>

We poll PyPI for updates every 5 minutes.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How do I customize my plugin's listing?"
  variant="faq"
>

We source metadata for your plugin's listing from both PyPI and Github.
In addition to a bunch of standard PyPI stuff, we support additional custom fields,
like a user-friendly description to complement your Github README.
Check out [Customizing your plugin's listing](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/blob/main/docs/customizing-plugin-listing.md)
to see what metadata we will present and where we source it from.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How do I add a shield/badge for the napari hub to my repository?"
  variant="faq"
>

The napari hub supports [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) shields for your repository linking to your plugin’s
listing page. If you want to add a shield to your README or other markdown files,
you can copy & paste the snippet:

```
[![napari hub](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.napari-hub.org/shields/<your-plugin-name-here>)](https://napari-hub.org/plugins/<your-plugin-name-here>)
```

If you just want the badge SVG, you can access that at the URL below.

```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://api.napari-hub.org/shields/<your-plugin-name-here>
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Can I preview my listing before I upload my plugin?"
  variant="faq"
>

Yes, you can! The [napari-hub-cli](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub-cli)
is a command-line tool that lets you preview your metadata and make sure that you’ve
included everything the hub is looking for. Simply install it on your local development
machine and point it at your local repository.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How do I remove my plugin from the napari hub?"
  variant="faq"
>

If you remove your plugin from PyPI or yank a release, it will be removed from the napari hub within approximately 5 minutes.

If you want your plugin to be available on PyPI, but not be visible on the napari hub, let us know by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/issues/new)
or sending an email to <team@napari-hub.org> and we’ll manually remove it from our listings.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title={`"My plugin is on PyPI, but why isn’t it showing up in the hub?"`}
  variant="faq"
>

We check PyPI every 5 minutes, so if you just pushed it to PyPI, you might just need to go and get a cup of coffee.

Search PyPI directly for your plugin among those tagged with [“Framework :: napari”](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+napari)

If your plugin is on PyPI, but not showing up in that search, then you don’t have the “Framework :: napari” trove classifier properly defined.

If your plugin does show up under [“Framework :: napari”](https://pypi.org/search/?c=Framework+%3A%3A+napari)
on PyPI, but not on the hub, go and grab a cup of coffee.
If it still doesn’t show up after 5 minutes, [open an issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=)
and our team will look into it as soon as we can.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title={`I updated my ".napari" directory in Github. Why aren’t my changes showing up?`}
  variant="faq"
>

We only pull plugin info from Github when we detect a new plugin or new release on PyPI.
However, if you’d like to update your plugin listing with the latest metadata from your Github repo,
just let us know by [_submitting an issue_](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/issues/new)
and we can manually trigger a refresh of your plugin metadata from Github.

</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title={`Why isn't my plugin "open source"?`}
  variant="faq"
>

To be considered an “open source” plugin, the hub must be able to detect that your
plugin is distributed with an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).
That happens in one of two ways:

- If you’ve linked to a Github repository, we’ll source [the license from Github’s API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/licenses#get-the-license-for-a-repository), which inspects your LICENSE file and infers the correct license.
- If Github fails to identify your license, we’ll fallback on whatever you’ve specified in your Python setup. _Note: this MUST be a valid [SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) in order to be detected as an “open source” license, such as “BSD-3-Clause”... “BSD-3” will not be recognized as “open source”._

For more information on how we source this metadata, see [the "License" section of "Customizing your plugin's listing"](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/blob/main/docs/customizing-plugin-listing.md#license)
