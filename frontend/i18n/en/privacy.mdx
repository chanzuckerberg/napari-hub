## We Collect and Use Limited Personal Information About You

If you subscribe to our mailing list, we will collect personally identifiable information that you provide by signing up on our Website. We will use this mailing list to send you newsletters and other communications (e.g. announcements about developments). We are based in the US and we use a service provider to help us manage our mailing list. [_Learn more about Mailchimp's privacy practices here_](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

## Our Website Analytics Tool Does Not Collect Personal Information About You

We use the privacy-friendly Plausible as our website analytics tool. [_Learn more about Plausible’s data and privacy practices here_](https://plausible.io/data-policy) and [_view the public dashboard for napari-hub.org here_](https://plausible.io/napari-hub.org).

## We Do Not Host Any Plugins

napari plugins are specialized Python packages. Our website exposes information about these packages that the authors have distributed on [_PyPI_](https://pypi.org/) based on publicly available data from [_PyPI_](https://pypi.org/) and [_Github_](https://github.com/). Learn more about [_PyPI’s data and privacy practices here_](https://www.python.org/privacy/), and view [_Github’s data and privacy practices here_](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

- You can email us at [team@napari-hub.org](mailto:team@napari-hub.org) if you _do not_ want your plugin to appear on our website.

When we pull information from these websites, it may also include the information provided in the author field (such as name and email address). We are unable to prevent disclosure of this information if it has been provided by the author to PyPI or Github.

- If you _do not_ want the information in the author field to be displayed, please remove that information from the source website.

## Sharing Data

- We will never sell your data or share it with anyone that will sell your data.
- We may share your data with service providers in order to provide services (see above) and where we believe it is legally required or useful to protect or defend our rights or property or others; and/or to investigate or assist in preventing any violation of the law or harm to a person.

## Your Rights

- Applicable laws may provide you rights with request to your personal data, such as the right to access and/or delete your data, object to our use of your data, or revoke your consent to our use of your data.
