      tags to `display: block`:
      https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight#images-are-block-level.

      We don't want this for markdown because it affects rendering of markdown
      badges. Usually devs will include a bunch of badges together at the top
      of the file. If all of the images are `display: block` by default, the
      badges get rendered as a column instead of as row.

      Also, having images rendered as blocks in markdown is redundant because
      the markdown renderer will automatically wrap the image in a <p> tag to
      ensure that the image is displayed as a block.
