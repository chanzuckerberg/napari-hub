The [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org) lets napari users find community-built plugins that solve their analysis needs.  It hosts a growing ecosystem of plugins for segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, file loading, and more. 

Our vision is to support the imaging community by ensuring that researchers can easily find plugins that meet their needs and be confident that they will work and work together to support reproducible workflows. 
We want to let plugin developers identify unmet needs in the ecosystem, capture actionable feedback to improve their plugins, and communicate the impact of their work to their funders.
