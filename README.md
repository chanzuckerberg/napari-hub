The [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org) lets [napari](https://napari.org) users find community-built plugins that solve their analysis needs.  It hosts a growing ecosystem of plugins for segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, file loading, and more.

## Our goal

We seek to support the napari community by seeding and growing a healthy ecosystem of napari plugins that enable the imaging community to perform advanced analysis of imaging and microscopy data sets within napari’s rich interactive interface. To do make this happen, we need to

1. enable the **bioimaging analysis community** to easily build, share and maintain napari plugins
2. make it easy for **biology researchers** and **imaging scientists** to find, evaluate, and install these plugins
3. make sure that **plugin developers** can get feedback for improvement and credit for their work

## **What are we building now?**

Over the second half of 2021, we are committed to...

* **Improve** the process of finding, evaluating, and installing napari plugins
* **Lower barriers** for plugin developers to build, share, and maintain their plugins
* **Learn** more about what metrics give plugin users signal about quality and give plugin developers actionable feedback

You can find our roadmap and other insights into our process (UXR studies, tech specs, designs, and more) by visiting the [napari hub’s wiki.](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/wiki)

## How can you help?

Interested in helping us grow a thriving community of plugins for napari? There are a few ways you can get involved.

### Join a UXR session

We rely heavily on User Experience Research to understand the needs and challenges of the bioimaging community, identify opportunities for solutions to these challenges, and get feedback on our work. Whether you’re a bench scientist, work at an imaging core, or develop computational methods, sign up here and we’ll reach out when there’s an interview, focus group, or workshop that matches your background.

### Share your ideas

Do you have ideas for new features that would help make the napari hub even better? [Join the discussion](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/discussions), add [your ideas](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/discussions/categories/ideas), and give feedback on other’s ideas.

### Report any bugs

Bugs happen. If something isn’t working right for you on the hub, please let us know by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/issues).

### Help with open issues

Are you savvy with web development and want to contribute code? We’d love your help tackling some of the “[good first issues](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/contribute)” we’ve tagged.
