# **9. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.** 

THIS SECTION CONSTITUTES AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (“**Arbitration Agreement**”); IT REQUIRES YOU AND CZIF AND ITS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE, LLC (COLLECTIVELY, THE “**CZ Parties**”) TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, SO PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. 

9.1 **Applicability.** You and the CZ Parties agree that all Disputes, including Enforceability Disputes, will be resolved exclusively in binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and the CZ Parties are not required to arbitrate IP Disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the CZ Parties may bring an individual action in small claims court.

i. A “**Dispute**” means a dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the CZ Parties’ products or these Terms; or whether that dispute is (1) based on past, present or future events; and (2) in contract, warranty, state, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. 

ii. An “**Enforceability Dispute**” means a Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, including the formation of the contract, the arbitrability of any Dispute, and any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable. 

iii. An “**IP Dispute**” means a Dispute relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights.

9.2 **Waivers.**

i. **Waiver of Jury Right.** YOU AND THE CZ Parties ARE EXPRESSLY GIVING UP ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR COURT TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding on both you and us, subject to review solely on the grounds set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”).

ii. **Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.** YOU AND THE CZ PARTIES AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. The validity of this waiver – and whether an action may proceed as a class, collective or representative action – must be decided by a court.

9.3 **Initiating a Dispute.** 

i. To initiate a Dispute, a party must send to the other party written notice of that Dispute containing: (a) the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice; (b) the facts giving rise to the Dispute; and (c) the relief requested. 

ii. You and we agree that we shall (in good faith) meet and attempt to resolve the Dispute within 30 days. If the Dispute is not resolved during that time period, then you and a representative of the CZ Party shall (in good faith) meet and attempt to resolve the Dispute through non-binding mediation with a mutually agreed-upon mediator within 30 additional days. If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within that 60-day period, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. 

9.4 **Arbitration Rules and Procedure.** 

i. **Rules.** The FAA governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Judicial Arbitration & Mediation Services, Inc. (“**JAMS**”) will administer the arbitration before a single arbitrator, and the arbitration will be initiated and conducted according to the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “**JAMS Rules**”), to the extent they are not inconsistent with the terms of this agreement. The JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration (as of the date of this agreement) or [1-800-352-5267](tel:18003525267).

ii. **Fees.** Pursuant to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards, the CZ Parties will bear all costs of the arbitration (including any JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services), except for the filing fee if you are the party initiating the arbitration. 

iii. **Manner and Location of Arbitration.** You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, in writing, online, or in person. If in person, you may choose to have the arbitration conducted (a) in San Mateo County, California, (b) in the county where you live, or (c) at another location that you and we agree upon. 

9.5 **Confidentiality.** All aspects of the arbitration, including without limitation the record of the proceeding, are confidential and will not be open to the public, except (a) to the extent both parties agree otherwise in writing, (b) as may be appropriate in any subsequent proceedings between the parties, or (c) as may otherwise be appropriate in response to a governmental agency or legal process, provided that the party upon whom such process is served shall give immediate notice of such process to the other party and afford the other party an appropriate opportunity to object to such process.

9.6 **Opt-Out.** You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement by notifying us by mail no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to it. Your notice must include your name, address, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. 

9.7 **Severability.** If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that portion shall be severed and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

# **10. Miscellaneous.**

10.1 **Severability.** In the event any part of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in effect and you and we expressly authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to make the modifications that are necessary to comply with existing law, in a manner most closely representing the original intent of you and us as expressed in these Terms.

10.2 **Assignment.** You may not assign or delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, without our prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld); any assignment or delegation in violation of this provision will be null and void. We may assign our rights or delegate our obligations under these Terms. In the event of an assignment by us, we will provide you notice through the Service or contact information you have provided to us and these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and shall bind the permitted assignee.

10.3 **Amendment.** No waiver of any of the provisions of the Terms will constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar). No waiver will be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound by the waiver.

10.4 **Entire Agreement.** These Terms (along with the [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/blob/main/docs/legal/napari-hub-github-app-privacy-policy.md).) constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the App.
