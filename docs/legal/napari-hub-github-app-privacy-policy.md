****Vendors and Other Third Parties.****

CZIF has built, and designed the App so that it can be as useful as possible to our users. CZI LLC is our primary technology partner, focusing on the App’s infrastructure, security, and compliance. CZIF and CZI LLC are both data controllers for data within the App and will use data only as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may also share Personal Data with analytics vendors that assist us to improve and optimize the App. To learn more about our vendors we use, please contact us at team@napari-hub.org.

If we can no longer keep operating the App or believe that its purpose is better served by having another entity operating it, we will transfer the App and all data existing therein so that the Users can continue to be served. We will always let you know *before* this happens, and you will have the option to delete your account and any data you’ve uploaded. Should this occur, the entity to which we transfer your data will be obliged to use it in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the Terms.

We may disclose Personal Data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (c) to protect or defend our rights or property or those of Users; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms.

****How We Protect the Information.****

We use industry standard security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data uploaded into the App. This includes practices like encrypting connections to the App using TLS, hosting the App on leading cloud providers with robust physical security, and ensuring that access to any personal data within the App by staff working on the tool is strictly limited. 

Security takes ongoing work and we will continue to monitor and adjust our security measures as the App develops. Please notify us immediately at [security@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:security@chanzuckerberg.com) if you suspect your account has been compromised or are aware of any other security issues relating to the App.

****How Long We Retain Data and Data Deletion.****

We retain your personal data only as long as is reasonably necessary. Data relating to your account is retained until you delete your account on the App as such data is required to manage the service.

Users may submit account deletion requests by emailing team@napari-hub.org. We will delete personal data within 60 days following the close of your account.

Please note that we do not control, and so cannot delete, personal data that Users have copied outside of the App.

****Choices About Your Data.****

If you are a User, you have the following choices:

* Users are able to request the deletion of Personal Data associated with their account. 
* Users are able to request that any incorrect Personal Data associated with their account be rectified.
* Users are able to request a copy of their Personal Data they have provided to us by emailing team@napari-hub.org. 
* Users may also object to the processing of their Personal Data in certain circumstances by emailing team@napari-hub.org. In such cases, we will stop processing that data unless we have legitimate grounds to continue processing it -- for example, it is needed for legal reasons. 
* Users have a right to withdraw consent, such as if they have consented to receiving emails from us. This does not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out by us prior to consent being withdrawn.
* Users can also contact us by emailing team@napari-hub.org should they wish to access, restrict the processing of, or rectify their User Data.

Please contact us at team@napari-hub.org if you would like to exercise the privacy choices discussed above or if you have any questions.

****Data Transfers.****

The App is a global service. By using the App, Users authorize us to transfer and store the uploaded data outside of your home country, including to the United States, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

If you want to use the App, you must first agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between us and our Users. 

We operate in countries worldwide (including in the United States) and use technical infrastructure in the United States to deliver the Services to you. In accordance with the contract between us and our Users, we need to transfer personal data to the United States and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services. Such transfers are necessary for the correct functioning of the App. Please note that the privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in these countries may not be the same as in your home country.
