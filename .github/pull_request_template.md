<!--
When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep PRs reasonably sized. Max 500 LOC is ideal. Prefer splitting into multiple PRs if you can.
2. Include a description of what your PR does and any background information for nuanced topics.
3. Do not request code reviews until the PR checks pass.
4. Include screenshots / videos for PRs if there are visual changes.

A good example is https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/pull/77.

		- Add non-closing keywords and link the issues, e.g. "Addresses #issue-number"
		- Set the status for the issue to “Pending QA & Release” upon merging
		- Provide a checklist of any relevant pre-deployment notes, e.g. whether a config or database change is needed
	- If changes do not require a deployment (e.g. documentation, CI changes, unit tests)
