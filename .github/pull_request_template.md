<!--
When creating a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep PRs reasonably sized. Max 500 LOC is ideal. Prefer splitting into multiple PRs if you can.
2. Include a description of what your PR does and any background information for nuanced topics.
3. Do not request code reviews until the PR checks pass.
4. Include screenshots / videos for PRs if there are visual changes.

A good example is https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/pull/77.
